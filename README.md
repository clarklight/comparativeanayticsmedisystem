# comparativeanayticsmedisystem
Trying to investigate an automated comparative analytics system for gene therapy and related genetic illness. 

The idea of this project is based on the expenses and cost for treatment for many illness especially life threating illness is way too high, and as the rise of computing power/gene therapy/algorithm and AI is getting much easier/cheaper to operate. The possibility for smaller indivdual to aid reduce the cost for finding treatment is "hopefully" easier hence lowering the cost and helping more and more people so they wont be separted from their loved ones and kids with genetic illness will be given a chance to live and go to school happily. 

The idea is based on 2 parts 
- The analytics (Automate research, with a comparative analytic algorithm to identify genes that is causing issues, hence reducing the burden of many many researchers, and speed up the processes so researchers can switch their focus onto areas such as speed up the process for pushing treatment to mass market)  
- Creating the treatment ("manufacturing - Example CAR-T cell treatment, a treatment at the moment cost $432,000, many of these cost are accounting for expensive professional staff doing manual work. If the production is driven up then the cost for the same staff ratio will be reduced drastically) - so the idea is automate whatever it is possible with robotics, as DNA sequencer cost is reducing, computation tools are also reducing. The idea is to link up the whole process of clients providing a DNA sample, to a sequencer like a vending machine, so no staff is required, and the whole process begin to a treatment is manufactured, in the CAR-T cell example will be the injection back into the body. 


This project will be very long, hopefully i wont give up and can help people with it.

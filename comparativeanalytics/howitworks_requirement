How it works????? Requirements 
(Prequisite - I am not sure if large medical research companies are already doing this.....) 

- Sample requirement 
- A DNA Sequencer 
- An algorithm to compare all the DNA sample


Steps of the idea (The idea drives for as much automation as possbile to reduce cost so it becomes affordable for everyone) 

- A User will provide samples 
- Large collective sample will be collected 
- 1 targetted Sample with a specific disease will be compared with a large data set of data without the disease 
- So the disease genetic will stand out if compared to 
- The DNA sets will be compared one to one against the targeted set, so we can narrow down to the specific genes that is causing the problem 


Tech idea/scenario 
- Soon as the sample is turned into datasets, then everything will become a pure coding project
_ From a coding perspective, it is simply trying to find the difference of a specific dataset from multiple data sets.

How it works????? Requirements 
(Prequisite - I am not sure if large medical research companies are already doing this.....) 

- DNA Samples 
- A DNA Sequencer 
- An algorithm to compare all the DNA samples


Steps of the idea (The idea drives for as much automation as possbile to reduce cost so it becomes affordable for everyone) 

- A User will provide samples 
- Large collective sample will be collected 
- 1 targetted Sample with a specific disease will be compared with a large data set of data without the disease 
- So the disease genetic will stand out if compared to 
- The DNA sets will be compared one to one against the targeted set, so we can narrow down to the specific genes that is causing the problem 
(Whole process from start to finish will be automated, Human will be there to confirm and analyze the final result to confirm)

Tech idea/scenario 
- Soon as the sample is turned into datasets, then everything will become a pure coding project
_ From a coding perspective, it is simply trying to find the difference of a specific dataset from multiple data sets. 


So how are we going to turn this into practical solution (What we need and steps)
- A DNA sequencer and provides DNA samples 
- Linking the DNA sequencer into a computer for analytics 
- A program that can receive the data packets from the sequencer 
- A program that will store then analyze/compare the datasets until there is a result. 



Next step, will be research to see the DNA sequencer, data packets, connectivity and testing a data packet for a simple algo to see the feasbility. 


Below links to an example of the data format that is outputted from the DNA analyzer.

Further research with the DNA analysis Node.js 
http://thejackalofjavascript.com/dna-analysis-node-js/
And many related technology such as Genome.js and datapackets for analysis. 

Within the link it gives an example of using a genome to check the person's gender using Genoset 144 â€“ Male example.
